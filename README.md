# Async Rust Interactive Course ðŸš€

An interactive, test-driven course for mastering asynchronous programming in Rust.

## Quick Start

1. **Start with Module 1**: `cd exercises/01_foundations && cargo test`
2. **Read the async book** alongside the exercises
3. **Make tests pass** by implementing the TODOs
4. **Experiment** and break things to understand them better

## Module Progress

- [ ] **Module 1**: Async Foundations (`exercises/01_foundations`)
- [ ] **Module 2**: Runtime & Execution (`exercises/02_runtime`) 
- [ ] **Module 3**: Advanced async/await (`exercises/03_async_await`)
- [ ] **Module 4**: Concurrency Patterns (`exercises/04_concurrency`)
- [ ] **Module 5**: Streams (`exercises/05_streams`)
- [ ] **Project**: Chat Server (`projects/chat_server`)

## Learning Tips

- ðŸ”„ **Iterate**: `cargo check` â†’ `cargo test` â†’ implement â†’ repeat
- ðŸ§ª **Experiment**: Break working code to understand error messages
- ðŸ“– **Read**: Use the async book as reference
- ðŸ’¡ **Understand**: Don't just make tests pass, understand why

## Get Help

- Read test failure messages carefully
- Check the book sections for each module
- Experiment with `println!` for debugging
- Time your code to see concurrency in action

Happy learning! ðŸŽ‰
